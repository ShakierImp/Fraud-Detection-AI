Slide 1: Title Slide
------------------------------------------------------------
Title: FraudGuardian AI: Real-Time Transaction Monitoring
Subtitle: Machine Learning-Powered Fraud Detection System
Team Members: [Name 1 – ML Engineer], [Name 2 – Backend Developer], [Name 3 – Data Scientist], [Name 4 – UI/UX & Dashboard]
Hackathon: [Hackathon Name/Logo Placeholder]

Speaker Notes:
Start with a strong hook: "Financial fraud costs businesses and consumers over $XX billion annually. We built FraudGuardian AI to fight back in real time."

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 2: The Problem
------------------------------------------------------------
- Rising transaction fraud with billions lost yearly
- False positives hurt customer trust and experience
- Fraudsters constantly adapt with new patterns
- Traditional systems are slow, rigid, and reactive

Speaker Notes:
Emphasize the dual pain points: heavy financial losses and customer friction due to false alarms. Current solutions can’t keep up with evolving fraud tactics.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 3: Our Solution
------------------------------------------------------------
- Real-time fraud detection API
- Ensemble machine learning approach
- Explainable and interpretable risk scores
- Easy integration into existing systems

Speaker Notes:
Position FraudGuardian as both powerful and practical. Stress our hybrid ML approach and focus on explainability, not just predictions.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 4: Technology Stack
------------------------------------------------------------
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Optuna
- Frontend: Streamlit, optional React integration
- Deployment: Docker & Docker Compose

Speaker Notes:
Each choice balances speed, reliability, and a strong ML ecosystem. Highlight how FastAPI ensures low latency and Streamlit provides rapid visualization.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 5: Technical Methodology
------------------------------------------------------------
- Data pipeline: ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering
- Feature extraction: time, geography, transaction metadata
- Supervised models: detect known fraud signatures
- Unsupervised autoencoders: catch unseen anomalies
- Ensemble scoring for robust predictions

Speaker Notes:
Stress the dual-model approach—supervised models handle history, unsupervised catch the unknown. This combination is key to fighting adaptive fraud.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 6: Key Features & Innovation
------------------------------------------------------------
- Real-time predictions under 100ms
- Transparent risk scores for explainability
- Customizable thresholds per business needs
- Interactive dashboard with live analytics
- Extensible architecture for future models

Speaker Notes:
This is where we stand out—fast, explainable, and user-friendly. Fraud detection that builds trust, not black boxes.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 7: Demo Plan
------------------------------------------------------------
Live demo flow:
1. Upload a CSV of transactions
2. Real-time fraud risk scoring
3. Dashboard visualization of risk distribution
4. Downloadable fraud detection report

Speaker Notes:
Walk the judges through exactly what they’ll see—make the demo relatable, fast, and impressive.

------------------------------------------------------------
Slide 8: Impact & Future Roadmap
------------------------------------------------------------
- Businesses save millions by reducing fraud losses
- Scales to high-throughput environments
- Future features:
  - Real-time streaming pipeline (Kafka/Flink)
  - Broader ML model integration
  - Integration with bank & fintech APIs

Speaker Notes:
Close the loop by showing both short-term business value and a visionary roadmap—this could grow into a production-grade fintech solution.
