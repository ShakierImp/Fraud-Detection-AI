# FraudGuardian AI – Privacy and Security Considerations

This document outlines the privacy and security practices required for the **FraudGuardian AI** project, which processes sensitive financial transaction data. It is intended for developers, contributors, and stakeholders to ensure compliance with global privacy regulations and industry security standards.

## 1. Data Privacy Considerations

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Handling
- Identify and classify PII fields (e.g., name, email, account numbers, phone numbers).
- Do **not** store raw PII unless strictly necessary.
- Use pseudonymization or anonymization wherever possible.
- Ensure all developers are trained in proper handling of sensitive data.

### Data Anonymization Techniques
- **Remove or hash direct identifiers** (e.g., account IDs, phone numbers).
- **Generalize sensitive attributes** (e.g., replace exact timestamps with day/hour ranges).
- **Data masking** for display (e.g., `****1234` for card numbers).
- Apply **salted cryptographic hashes** for identifiers used in ML models.

### Data Retention Policy
- Retain only the **minimum data necessary** for fraud detection and analysis.
- Define clear retention timelines (e.g., 90 days for raw data, 1 year for aggregated statistics).
- Implement automatic deletion scripts for expired datasets.

### Compliance with Regulations
- **GDPR:** Ensure right-to-access, right-to-be-forgotten, and data minimization principles.
- **CCPA:** Provide transparency on data usage and allow opt-out of data sharing.
- **PCI DSS:** Comply with cardholder data protection standards when applicable.

## 2. Security Measures

### Encryption
- **At rest:** Use AES-256 encryption for databases and file storage.
- **In transit:** Use TLS 1.2+ for all API and service communications.
- Encrypt secrets and credentials using a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS).

### Access Control & Authentication
- Enforce **least privilege access** for developers and services.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for database and API access.
- Enforce **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for admin accounts.

### Secure Logging
- Do not log raw PII or sensitive financial data.
- Redact sensitive fields (e.g., account number → `****5678`).
- Store logs in a secure, access-controlled system (e.g., ELK, CloudWatch).

### API Security
- Require **JWT or OAuth2** for authentication.
- Apply **rate limiting** to prevent abuse.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Enable CORS restrictions to trusted domains only.

## 3. Anonymization Steps for Transaction Data

1. **Remove Direct Identifiers**
   - Strip fields like name, email, account ID.
   - Replace with salted hash (`SHA-256 + random salt`).

2. **Generalize Sensitive Fields**
   - Convert exact transaction timestamps to date + hour buckets.
   - Replace precise locations with region-level metadata.

3. **Data Masking**
   - Mask credit card numbers except last 4 digits.
   - Use tokenization for customer IDs.

4. **Aggregation**
   - Aggregate transaction patterns where possible instead of exposing raw records.

## 4. Best Practices for Financial Data Handling

- **PCI DSS Compliance**
  - Do not store CVV or full card numbers.
  - Mask primary account numbers in logs and outputs.

- **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
  - Threat modeling at the start of each sprint.
  - Static application security testing (SAST) before deployment.
  - Regular penetration testing.

- **Regular Security Audits**
  - Annual third-party audits.
  - Continuous vulnerability scanning (e.g., Dependabot, Trivy).

## 5. Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Data Minimization
- Collect only fields directly required for fraud detection.
- Exclude unnecessary metadata.

### Purpose Limitation
- Use transaction data strictly for fraud detection and related research.
- Explicitly prohibit use for marketing or profiling beyond fraud prevention.

### User Consent
- Ensure end-users are informed about data processing via a privacy policy.
- Provide mechanisms to opt-out where legally required.

## ✅ Summary – Actionable Recommendations

- Encrypt all data (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit).
- Hash and anonymize identifiers before ML processing.
- Implement strict access controls with RBAC + MFA.
- Redact sensitive info from logs.
- Follow GDPR/CCPA/PCI DSS compliance requirements.
- Regularly audit and test systems for vulnerabilities.
