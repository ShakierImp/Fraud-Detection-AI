# Ensemble Strategy for Fraud Detection System

## 1. Introduction & Rationale

Fraud detection is a high-stakes problem where adversaries constantly evolve their techniques. Relying on a **single detection method** (purely supervised or purely unsupervised) creates blind spots:

- **Supervised models** (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost) excel at identifying fraud patterns that have been observed in historical data. They provide high accuracy on known fraud types but may fail on **novel or unseen attacks**.
- **Unsupervised anomaly detectors** (e.g., Autoencoders, IsolationForest) are designed to detect unusual behaviors that deviate from normal patterns. They are less dependent on labeled data but may produce false positives.

By **combining both approaches** in an ensemble, we benefit from:
- The **precision** of supervised models for known fraud
- The **generalization power** of anomaly detectors for unknown fraud  
This strategy provides a **layered defense** that increases robustness and adaptability.

## 2. Scoring Rules

We define two sources of fraud risk evidence:

- **Supervised Model Score** (`S_supervised`):  
  Normalized probability output from classifiers such as RandomForest/XGBoost.  
  Range: `[0, 1]`

- **Anomaly Score** (`S_anomaly`):  
  Normalized reconstruction error (Autoencoder) or anomaly score (IsolationForest).  
  Higher values indicate more anomalous behavior.  
  Range: `[0, 1]`

The final risk score is a **weighted combination**:

```math
S_{final} = \alpha \cdot S_{supervised} + \beta \cdot S_{anomaly}
